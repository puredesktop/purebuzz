# purebuzz relay setup

[Back to the README](../README.md)

**purebuzz needs a separately running, compatible [Buzz relay](https://github.com/block/buzz).**
This repository contains the client app; it does not include or provision the relay server.
The relay stores and distributes messages and provides membership, search, and media services.
A generic public Nostr relay may not support the Buzz-specific APIs this client uses.

1. Follow the upstream [local setup guide](https://github.com/block/buzz#quick-start) to install its prerequisites and start the supporting services. In the Buzz checkout, run `just setup` and `just build`, then `just relay` with the upstream toolchain activated.
2. Open purebuzz in [puredesktop](https://puredesktop.ai). Enter the server’s WebSocket URL in the sidebar’s **Relay URL** field and click **Connect**. The default is `ws://localhost:3000` for local development; use your deployment’s `wss://` address for a hosted server.
3. Join using an invitation if your relay requires one, and wait for the connection status to become **connected** before chatting.

For a hosted deployment, see Buzz’s [production deployment documentation](https://github.com/block/buzz/tree/main/deploy/compose).
If connection fails, check that the relay is running, the URL is reachable, and your identity has membership access.
See [developer notes](dev-notes.md) for the client protocol and source layout.
